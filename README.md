# Parking-Space-v2


## Description

Parking Space is a Dapp where users are able to rent or sell owned parkings lot based off the ownership of NFTs. I was inspired to create this project by the issues of finding a parking spot in cities or malls of my country.

### Functionalities
1. Users can mint an NFT that represents a parking lot, A mint fee is required to be paid
2. Users are able to set the renting price and the selling price of a lot
3. Users are able to temporarily Rent this NFT to other users at a price
4. Users are able to sell the parking lot(through the NFT) 
5. Users can book and rent NFTs after paying the price
6. Users can buy a parking lot that is on sale


#### This is still a work in progress
